# Tinyproject
This is a project for my progamming 2 class 
## Features
- **Core Linear Algebra**
  - Vector class with arithmetic operations
  - Matrix class (determinant, inverse, pseudo-inverse)
  - Linear system solvers:
    - Gaussian elimination with pivoting
    - Conjugate gradient (symmetric systems)
    - Moore-Penrose inverse (rectangular systems)
  
- **Regression Pipeline**
  - Data standardization & outlier removal
  - Ridge regression with L2 regularization
  - K-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning
  - RMSE evaluation
